# **Hyperspectral imaging dataset**


![Hyperspectral imaging dataset](fig/Dataset.png)

<p style="text-align: justify;">
    We present the databases of hyperspectral images (HSIs) that were used to support our research. The images are of a wide variety of real-world materials and objects. We are making these databases available to the research community. Details of the database can be found in our manuscript.

## **1. Image Capture Information**

| Database  ID               | D1              | D2             |
| :------------------------- |:--------------- |:-------------- |
| range of wavelength        | 400-1000 nm     | 400-1700 nm    |
| spectral sampling interval | 10 nm           | 10 nm          |
| Number of bands            | 61              | 131            |
| Spatial resolution         | 960×1230 pixels | 640×660 pixels |
| Image format               | h5              | h5             |






## **2. Database Organization**

<p style="text-align: justify;">
    We have a total of <b>1000 scenes</b>, comprising <b>500 outdoor scenes</b> depicting various landscapes such as roads, buildings, flowers, vehicles and others, alongside <b>500 indoor scenes</b> showcasing items like food, cloth, toys and models. Two distinct database are provided, denoted as <b>Database 1 (D1)</b> and <b>Database 2 (D2)</b>, each corresponding these scenes. <b>D1</b> consists of original hyperspectral images captured using the Figspec-23 hyperspectral imaging system. And <b>D2</b> comprises hyperspectral images acquired through a process of registration and stitching from both the Figspec-23 and GaiaField Pro-N17EHR hyperspectral cameras, thereby integrating data from two distinct imaging devices.
    <br>The outdoor scenes were photographed in Beijing, China from April to June and October to December, encompassing various weather conditions including sunny, cloudy, and overcast. The indoor scenes were captured under laboratory illuminant (Thorlabs SLS302, 10W output optical power, 1115lux).
